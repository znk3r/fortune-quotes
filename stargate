Xe'ls: What they don't know won't hurt them. Isn't that what your leaders said? Their word means nothing!
Tekaya: As would mine! I gave my word to this one [indicates Jackson] so we could save you.
Xe'ls: Very well. I am listening but nothing might sway me from punishing you.
Col. O'Neill: For what? Showing Tonane who you really are? You've been posing as their gods for crying out loud.
Tekaya: Is that truly what you believe we do? When we drove away the Goa'uld a hundred years ago, we posed as their Spirits to guide and protect them without interferring. And now...
Xe'ls: You have disrupted the harmony between us. In time, they will learn to fear us, take the key, and forge weapons against us.
Dr. Jackson: No. Tonane's people are from this world. Even now they value the natural world above technology.
Col. O'Neill: Trust them. You shouldn't be posing as their gods.

(Joke explanation: The helmet of the Serpent guard looks like a snake, the Horus guard looks like an eagle with a golden beak, the Setesh guard helmet looks kind of like the head of an aardvark with elongated jackal ears, clearly fictitious, but overall not dog-like.)

Maj. Carter: [Sam smiles] Right.
Dr. McKay: What did you think I said?
Maj. Carter: Never mind.
Dr. McKay: I had a not-so-comfortable childhood. My parents hated each other. Blamed me. Music was my salvation. It had this ... perfect order for me.
Maj. Carter: [smiles, patronizing] That's nice, really.
Dr. McKay: When I was 12, my teacher told me to quit. A fine clinical player, he said, but no sense of the art whatsoever.
Maj. Carter: Why are you telling me this?
Dr. McKay: I'm just ... trying to bond.
Maj. Carter: Why?
Dr. McKay: Hospital gowns turn me on. [He smiles] I turned to science because I thought it would be different than music, but it isn't. It's just the same, it's just as much of an art as anything else.
Maj. Carter: Look, it's not your fault that the EM pulse didn't work.
Dr. McKay: You're an artist, Major. Maybe the best I've ever seen. I'm just critical because I'm jealous.
Maj. Carter: I'm touched, really. I wish I had a brilliant plan to draw up for you.
Dr. McKay: And you're funny, too. Even electrocuted. I mean, I've ... I've got nothing.

Col. O'Neill: [To Ramius] Greetings! Well, uh, I know how this looks. So, I think it's important we clear up any misunderstanding right away. We did not come to kill you. Honest. Am I right!? The fact is, and this is the fun part, we actually came to save your ass...es. All your asses. Do you see the irony? All right, there's this guy out there, big guy, big guy in a black suit. None too fond of you Goa'ulds. Well, anyway, he's the one we're after, not you. So if you want to let us go, we'll be on our way, to save the world another da—you're not buying this, are you?

Airman Wells: Then why did you have four?
Col. Dixon: Well, one's pretty bad, but you figure you got to have two so the little guy can have a brother or sister, right? Then you have two boys, and the wife says she want a girl so you figure "Hell, three can't be much harder than two", right? What you don't realize is that your brain's fried because you haven't slept. After three, four is no big deal. You're so deep in it that nothing seems to matter any more. It's chaos.

Vala: I did my best to blend in. At first according to Tomin and therefore as far as the villagers were concerned I was the woman who fell from the sky which made me feel kind of special.

Vala: The village was run by this complete bear of a man named Seevis, who was both barkeep and administrator which seemed the oddest contradiction. He claimed to be the most pious man in the village. If anyone strayed from the path of righteousness, it was Seevis who made sure you were severely punished for it. But seems to be a lot more leeway for sin in the religion of Origin than one would presume from all the preaching.

[regarding the anti-Ori weapon]
Lt. Colonel Mitchell: Hey, has anyone stopped to figure out how this thing might work? I mean, how do you kill something that's pure energy?
Dr. Jackson: Well, Merlin's research said nothing about killing. A more accurate translation would be "neutralize" or "cancel out".
Lt. Colonel Mitchell: Well, that still begs a lot of questions. How do you aim at something you can't see?
Dr. Jackson: Clearly, it can't be a weapon in the conventional sense. See, ascended beings transcend ordinary space time as we know it. This device would have to do the same thing.
Lt. Colonel Mitchell: In other words, you have no idea what it might be.
Dr. Jackson: Yeah, pretty much.

I always assumed that his experience was tainted by me.
Dr. Jackson: What are you talking about?
Vala: Well, she started off all sweet and innocent but now she's hellbent on domination of the galaxy.
Dr. Jackson: How old is she?
Vala: A few hours. [Dr. Jackson gives her a confused look.] The Ori used me to sneak one of their own across the border. This child is their way of cheating the ascended rulebook. They couldn't exactly cross over into our galaxy without getting into a confrontation with the Ancients, right? So they created a human representative with their knowledge to lead their armies.
Dr. Jackson: Sort of an uber-Prior, like the Doci?
Vala: Oh, but she's MUCH worse than that. The Priors are just pawns, but she knows the score. She's complicit with the Ori; you should have heard the propaganda that she just tried to feed me.
Dr. Jackson: Wait, wait, wait a minute, we're talking about a baby here, right?

Prior-Daniel: Well, obviously I'm improvising at this point. I had no idea when or even if I was going to be able to overcome the effects of the anti-Prior device. Time was running out. Adria's gonna notice my absence and become suspicious. So sending the rest of SG-1 to get the device was my only choice at the time.

In a bizarre twist of fate, I crashed right on top of the Goa'uld who ruled that planet [Vala timidly kicks the golden boots of the Goa'uld sticking out from under her ship]. Which was fortunate because my ship was too badly damaged to repair, and I needed help. The local villagers were very grateful [Vala walks with a crowd of Munchkins]. They introduced me to a lovely fair-haired Tok'ra who had been hiding out on the planet [Vala is shown listening to Carter, who is clearly made to look like Glenda the Good Witch, while both are tended to by Munchkins]. She told me the legend of a powerful ascended being who supposedly lived in some distant, far-off mountains, through a treacherous forest...
...I met up with a number of my friends along the way, and after a dangerous and eventful journey, we finally come face to face with the ascended being.

Dorothy Vala: Well, at first, I thought I just wanted to go home, but now I've decided I'd quite like to be a part of something... a regular part, if you catch my drift.
Oh, and, uh, these guys have their own issues. Boys?
[Behind Vala aka Dorothy are Col. Mitchell as the Scarecrow, Dr. Jackson as the Lion, and Teal'c as the Tin-Man]
Martin Lloyd [Dryly]: ...That's the Wizard of Oz.

Martin: Uh, Yeah.

Lt. Col. Sheppard: It's just an impulse I had, really...One I suspect I'm gonna have again next time I see him. He may not even have to say anything.
Dr. Weir: I've never seen you like this. What did Woolsey say to you?
Lt. Col Sheppard: Besides judging every damned decision you've ever made?
Dr. Weir: John Sheppard, are you defending my honor?
Lt. Col Sheppard:...And, judging me for agreeing with you.
Dr. Weir: Well, don't be too hard on him. I think of all the circling wolves, he's the least likely to actually bite. In fact, he might even convince the others to leave us alone.

[Elizabeth walks into the "Game Room" to find Lorne and Zelenka arguing. They are unaware of her entrance.]
Dr. Zelenka: Absurd!
Maj. Lorne: What are you talking about? It’s a perfectly reasonable request!
Dr. Zelenka: Oh yeah. Perfectly reasonable! I give you all of my food and my people starve.
[Elizabeth walks deeper into the room and sees the two of them on either side of the ‘games’ console. Radek is already on his feet and now Evan stands up to shout at him over the top of the screens.]
Maj. Lorne: I am not asking you for all of your food! Plus, I did say that we would make a deal.
Dr. Zelenka: [sarcastically] A deal. Oh yeah. Baskets.
Maj. Lorne: Big baskets! Two dozen of ‘em, hand-woven and very nice.
Dr. Zelenka: Oh, very nice. What am I gonna put in them, huh? Certainly not food!
[Elizabeth, still unnoticed by the two men, folds her arms and looks at them angrily. They continue to bicker, getting more and more agitated with every remark.]
Maj. Lorne: You know what? I think you’re holding out on me. I think you have plenty of food.
Dr. Zelenka: Are you calling me a liar?!
Maj. Lorne: No, I think you’re trying to squeeze me for a better deal, that’s what I think.
Dr. Zelenka: I have got nothing to hide! Now, if you’re ...
Maj. Lorne: OK, OK, so maybe I’ll send some of my army troops down and we’ll have a look!
Dr. Weir: [very angrily] What the hell are you two doing?
[The two finally notice her presence and look down, ashamed. Both of them are wearing expressions akin to ones that you would find on the faces of children who have just been found stealing cookies from the cookie jar.]
Dr. Weir: I thought I gave specific orders to stay away from this device.
Dr. Zelenka: [quietly, ashamed] Yes, yes, you did.
Maj. Lorne: We just saw that there were some people in trouble and we thought that maybe that we could...um...help.

Baden: It didn’t used to be.
Dr. Weir: OK, see, I think I know where that comes from. Did M - the Oracle tell you that citrus fruit was bad?
Nola: He made us aware of its toxic properties, yes.
Baden: Everything is toxic to you! [to Elizabeth] If they’re not busy insulting us, they’re complaining about contaminated food, improper hygiene. Even the sunlight is dangerous to them!

Dr. Weir: We’ve said goodbye to a lot of friends today. Our mission is a dangerous one. We lose people – a fact we’re all painfully aware of. But Carson was ... (She trails off for several seconds, temporarily lost for words.) I can’t remember anyone coming to me with a complaint against him – ever. He was a kind soul. He was ... he was a healer. And he will be very deeply missed. George Fabricius said, “Death comes to us all, but great achievements, they build a monument which shall endure until the sun grows cold.” (Her voice begins to break.) Every single life Carson saved is a monument to him. And that gives me great comfort.

Zelenka: I'm all yours. What would you like to try now?
McKay: Actually, unencumbered by the continual need to explain things to you, I've actually made remarkable progress.
Zelenka: Oh, really?
McKay: Mmm. [they start walking into the lab] The systems the Ancients had in place were designed to create fully functional humanoid replicants, right?
Zelenka: [suddenly pensive] ...yes.
McKay: Well, turns out that trying to create something much simpler is – ironically – much more difficult. In the end I was forced to compromise.
Zelenka: Wait, you're not suggesting that...
McKay: Ah, I know it wasn't part of the plan but it was either this or nothing.

Dr. McKay: Controlled magnetic harmonic resonance.
Dr. Jackson: What?
Dr. McKay: Apparently Tesla was close to something like this before Edison trashed his lab.
Dr. Jackson: What are you talking about?
Dr. McKay: That wall was specially designed to destabilize when bombarded with a very specific harmonic resonance. That's what the tones were. And the strong magnetic property of the particles is what keeps the door from just crumbling into dust. It's a great way to hide a door, because you know, if you're looking for a door to open it's never going to be found.
