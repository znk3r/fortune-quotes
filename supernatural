Dean: Meg.
Meg possessing Sam: No. Not anymore. Now, I'm Sam. [Another punch.] By the way –- [he grabs Dean’s shoulder, where Dean has a very tender bullet wound] –- I saw your dad there. He says, "Howdy." All that I had to hold onto was that I would climb out one day, and that I was gonna torture you, nice and slow. Like pulling the wings off an insect. But whatever I do to you, it's nothing compared to what you do to yourself, is it? I can see it in your eyes, Dean. You're worthless. You couldn't save your dad. And deep down... you know that you can't save your brother. They'd have been better off without you.

Dean: Do you even know how far off the reservation you've gone? How far from normal? From human?
Sam: I'm just exorcising demons.
Dean: With your mind! What else can you do?
Sam: I can send them back to hell. It only works with demons, and that's it.
Dean: What else can you do?!
Sam: I told you!
Dean: And I have every reason in the world to believe that.
Sam: Look, I should have said something. I'm sorry, Dean. I am. But try to see the other side here.
Dean: The other side?
Sam: I'm pulling demons out of innocent people.
Dean: Use the knife!
Sam: The knife kills the victim! What I do, most of them survive! Look, I've saved more people in the last five months than we save in a year.
Dean: That what Ruby want you to think? Huh? Kind of like the way she tricked you into using your powers? Slippery slope, brother. Just wait and see. Because it's gonna get darker and darker, and God knows where it ends.
Sam: I'm not gonna let it go too far.
Dean: [smashes lamp] It's already gone too far, Sam. If I didn't you know... I would want to hunt you. And so would other hunters.
Sam: You were gone. I was here. I had to keep on fighting without you. And what I'm doing... it works.
Dean: Well, tell me. If it's so terrific, then why'd you lie about it to me? Why did an angel tell me to stop you?
Sam: What?
Dean: Cas' said that if I don't stop you, he will. See what that means, Sam? That means that God doesn't want you doing this. So, are you just gonna stand there and tell me everything is all good?

Dean: Your orders were to follow my orders?
Castiel: It was a test, to see how you would perform under... battlefield conditions, you might say.
Dean: It was a witch, not the Tet Offensive. So I uh- failed your test, huh? I get it. But you know what? If you would have waved that-that magic time traveling wand of yours and we had to do it all over again, I'd make the same call. 'Cause, see, I don't know what's gonna happen when these Seals are broken. Hell, I don't even know what's gonna happen tomorrow. But what I do know is, that this, here? These kids, the swings, the trees? All of it is still here because of my brother and me.

Dean: You were?
Castiel: These people, they're all my Father's creations. They're works of art, and yet, even though you stopped Samhain, the Seal was broken and we are one step closer to Hell on Earth, for all creation. Now, that's not an expression Dean. It's a literal. You, of all people, should appreciate what that means. Can I tell you something, if you promise not to tell another soul?

Dean: You want me to gank a monster or torch a corpse, hey, lets light it up, right? Bu- But this? If we fix whatever this is, people are going to start dropping dead. Good people.
Sam: Look, I-I don't want them to die either, Dean, but there's a... natural order.
Dean: You're kidding right?
Sam: [laughing] What?
Dean: You don't see the irony in that? I mean, you and me, we're like the poster boys of the unnatural order. All we do is ditch death.
Sam: Yeah, but the normal rules don't really apply to us. Do they?
Dean : We're no different than anybody else.
Sam : I'm infected with demon blood. You've been to Hell. Look, I know you want to think of yourself as Joe the Plumber, Dean, but you're not. Neither am I. The sooner you accept that the better off you're gonna be.

Tessa: I've been around death from the get-go. You know what I see most? Lies. "He's in a better place." "At least they're together now." You all lie to yourselves, Dean because, like you said, deep down you're all scared. Stop lying to yourself, Dean.
Dean: What?
Tessa: "The angels have something good in store for you." "A second chance." Really? Because, I'm pretty sure... deep down you know something nasty's coming down the road. Trust your instincts, Dean. There's no such thing as miracles.

Dean: What's goin' on, Cas? Since when does Uriel put a leash on you?
Castiel: My superiors have begun to question my sympathies.
Dean: Your sympathies?
Castiel: I was getting too close to the humans in my charge: you. They feel I've begun to express emotions; doorways to doubt. This can impair my judgment.

Dean: Just give me the demon's name, Alastair.
Alastair: But he said, "nein," each and every time. Damned if I couldn't break him. Pulled out all the stops. But John, he was made of something unique, the stuff of heroes. And then came Dean. Dean Winchester. I thought I was up against it again. But, daddy's little girl, he broke. He broke in thirty. Ah, just not the man your daddy wanted you to be, huh, Dean? No. Now we're getting somewhere. Holy water? Come on, Grasshopper, you're gonna have to get creative to impress me.
Dean: You know something, Alastair? I could still dream, even in Hell. And over and over and over, you know what I dreamt? I dreamt of this moment. And believe me... I've got a few ideas. Let's get started.

Dean: You're lying.
Alastair: "And it is written that the first Seal shall be broken when a righteous man sheds blood in hell. As he breaks, so shall it break." We had to break the first Seal before any others. Only way to get the dominoes to fall, right? Topple the one at the front of the line. When we win, when we bring on the Apocalypse and burn this earth down, we'll owe it all to you, Dean Winchester. Believe me, son, I wouldn't lie about that. It's kind of a religious sort of thing, I think.

Dean: Was it the demons?
Castiel: It was disobedience. He was working against us.
Dean: Is it true? Did I break the first Seal? Did I start all this?
Castiel: Yes. When we discovered Lilith's plan for you, we laid siege to Hell. And we fought our way to get to you before you–
Dean: Jump-started the apocalypse.
Castiel: We were too late.
Dean: Why didn't you just leave me there, then?
Castiel: It's not blame that falls on you, Dean. It's fate. "The righteous man who begins it is the only one who can finish it." You have to stop it.
Dean: Lucifer? The apocalypse? What does that mean? Hey! Don't you go disappearing on me you son of a bitch. What does that mean?

Zachariah: All I'm saying is, it's how you look at it. Most folks live and die without moving anything more than the dirt it takes to bury them.

Sam: I would give anything, anything, to take it all back-

I know how messed up that sounds, which means, I know how messed up I am...The thing is, the problem’s not the demon blood, not really, I mean, I- what I did, I can't blame the blood, or Ruby, or...anything.

I never lied, Dean. That's important. It's fundamental. But...there is one story about Cain that I might have... forgotten to tell you. Apparently, he, too, was willing to accept death, rather than becoming the killer the Mark wanted him to be. So he took his own life with the Blade. He died.

That kid is going to spend his whole life knowing that he had his shot and that he couldn't beat me, that ain't mercy. That's the worst thing I could have done to him.

Sam: So, I've been thinking, look. Cain still has the Mark right? And he's lived with it, for years he's lived with it. So yeah, the Mark is strong, but Dean maybe there's a part of you that wants to give into it, and maybe you have to fight that, you know? Maybe part of that powerful force has to be you.

Cain: From your fate. Has it ever occurred to you? Have you never mused upon the fact that you are living my life in reverse. My story began when I killed my brother, and that's where your story will inevitably end.
Dean: No. Never.
Cain: It's called the Mark of Cain for a reason! First, first you'd kill Crowley... there'd be some strange mixed feelings on that one, but you'd have your reason, get it done, no remorse. And then you'd kill the angel Castiel, now that one, that I suspect would hurt something awful. And then... Then would come the murder you'd never survive, the one that would finally turn you into as a much of a savage as it did me... your brother Sam.
